.SH DESCRIPTION

This program is not to be executed from the command line.
It is 
exec'd by mpdroot to verify the version of python before executing
a 'regular' mpd pgm, e.g. mpdallexit.
.SH FUNCTIONS
\fBctime\fP(\.\.\.)
\fBctime\fP(seconds) -> string
.RS
.PP
Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
This is equivalent to \fBasctime\fP(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
not present, current time as returned by \fBlocaltime\fP() is used.
.RE
.PP
\fBexit\fP(\.\.\.)
\fBexit\fP([status])
.RS
.PP
Exit the interpreter by raising \fBSystemExit\fP(status).
If the status is omitted or None, it defaults to zero (i.e., success).
If the status is numeric, it will be used as the system exit status.
If it is another kind of object, it will be printed and the system
exit status will be one (i.e., failure).
