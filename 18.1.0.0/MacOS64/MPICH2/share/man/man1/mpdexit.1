.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: mpdexit mpdid
mpdid may be obtained via mpdtrace \fB-l\fP (or may be "localmpd")
Causes a single mpd to exit (and thus exit the ring).
Note that this may cause other mpds to become 'isolated' if they
entered the ring through the exiting one.
.SH FUNCTIONS
\fBctime\fP(\.\.\.)
\fBctime\fP(seconds) -> string
.RS
.PP
Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
This is equivalent to \fBasctime\fP(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
not present, current time as returned by \fBlocaltime\fP() is used.
